# Professional SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

The application includes Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest.
